We would like to minimize bugs when we write code. If we encounter errors, we know something is going wrong, but some serious bugs don't stop the code.

# Bug??
* Values go wrong even if you are sure that you implemented the code correctly

# Write a debug function
* Write a debug function and try the code with a tiny data
* Make sure all counters work well

# Coding
* Break your function into small parts and make sure each component works fine.
