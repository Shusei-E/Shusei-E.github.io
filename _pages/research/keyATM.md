## Abstract
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
For a long time, many social scientists have conducted a content analysis by simply counting carefully selected key words and phrases contained in documents of interest. In recent years, however, probabilistic topic models have become increasingly popular because of their ability to uncover topics based on the co-occurrence of certain words. Unfortunately, applied researchers find that these models often fail to yield topics of their interest by inadvertently creating nonsensical topics, merging unrelated topics, or splitting a single coherent topic. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that providing topic models with a small number of keywords can dramatically improve their performance. The proposed approach, which we call keyword assisted topic modeling, offers an important advantage that the specification of keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to fitting a model to the data. This contrasts with post-hoc labeling, currently a widespread practice, that compromises the objectivity of empirical findings. In our applications, we find that keyword assisted topic models provide more interpretable results, have better document classification performance, and are more robust to the choice of the number of topics than the standard topic models.
