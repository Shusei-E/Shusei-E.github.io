## Abstract
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
For a long time, many social scientists have conducted content analysis by using their substantive knowledge and manually coding documents. In recent years, however, fully automated content analysis based on probabilistic topic models has become increasingly popular because of their scalability. Unfortunately, applied researchers ﬁnd that these models often fail to yield topics of their substantive interest by inadvertently creating nonsensical topics or multiple topics with similar content. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that providing topic models with a small number of keywords can substantially improve their performance. The proposed keyword assisted topic model (keyATM) oﬀers an important advantage that the speciﬁcation of keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to ﬁtting a model to the data. This contrasts with a widespread practice of post-hoc topic interpretation and adjustments that compromises the objectivity of empirical ﬁndings. In our applications, we ﬁnd that the keyATM provides more interpretable results, has better document classiﬁcation performance, and is more robust to the number of topics than the standard topic models. Finally, the keyATM can also incorporate covariates and model time trends.
